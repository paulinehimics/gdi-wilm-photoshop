## Suggested course description is below:

_Do you want to learn how to get started using Photoshop to do basic photo editing and to design simple graphics for the web?_

Photoshop is one of the most popular photo editing tools and web design tools out there. In this beginner workshop, you'll learn about essential options, tools, and simple techniques for working with photos and graphics.

We will cover:

* Document basics including dimensions and resolution 

* The Photoshop interface, from windows and workspaces to all those different tools and menu options (focusing on those used most frequently in a web workflow)

* Organizing files with layers, layer groups and layer comps 

* Basic techniques for working with photos and graphics

**Required Software:** Photoshop (NOT Photoshop Elements or other limited versions of the software - those do not have the same tools or capabilities)

With a free Creative Cloud membership, you can download a 30-day trial version of Photoshop - https://creative.adobe.com/plans - just make sure you've downloaded and opened prior to the class so you're certain it's fully installed and working on your computer. Photoshop can take a long time to download so don't wait until the last minute!
